<h2>Selection sort</h2>
<p>
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element.</p>
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n²) in best, average, and worst case<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1) — in-place sorting<br>

<h2>Bubble sort</h2>
<p>
Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong ordoer. With each pass, the largest element “bubbles up” to its correct position at the end.

<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n²) in average and worst case, O(n) in best case (already sorted)<br>
<b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1) — in-place sorting
